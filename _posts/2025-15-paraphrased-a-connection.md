All right. So, this is something a little bit short. Um, outside of, you know, me actually migrating to Odysee, GitHub, or Cloudflare Pages—I'm using GitHub Pages right now. But, um, if it's not going to work out, I'll just move everything over to Odysee because I am so [] tired of this big tech censorship [] and virtue signaling [], as well as basically everyone reporting my [], right? But well, it's not everyone. It's just two losers, and I know where they live.

Um, but I want to talk about the recession, the grifter economy, and an influencer. I can't say if I'm following or connected to her, and I have to change the way that she made this post.

Okay. So, let me look at the sentence about... so that way you guys won't [] with her and you [] won't [__] with me. Let me change the sentence real quick for the first sentence: "Dbags stopped connecting with me or contacting me when they saw that I wasn't going to answer their interview questions like any other stooge."

So, let me be very concise. I never gave a [__] about your follower count either. Okay. Yes, she totally said that. I think I'm reading it right now, but I'm just inverting it, so that way... because if I actually said what she said on LinkedIn, you're going to start stalking her. You can actually look people up by the sentence and not just by the name.

Um, and I don't want to give her extra heat from all the InfoSec grifters on social media. I have so many [] homies here, man. All these awesome ass []s, they, you know, put me through so many puzzles. And you know what? I had to go mentor a lot of people. Even when I say on LinkedIn, it's like, man, I need to go hit a lick.

Okay. But yeah, I'm just reframing it, you know, in a way... because I really don't want this to blow back on me and blow back on others. Um, but yeah, I decided to move to Odysee. I mean, I am keeping receipts of [] that are just stealing, basically stealing credit from me. I have watched the idiot actually make a fake sock account on a black hat hacking forum, copy and pasting literally everything. Everything. You know, and I'm like, what the [] is this? You know, every word that I said on my YouTube channel, every word or things that they basically scraped from an AI, you know, fire hose that literally misinformed them.

Yeah, I have that same problem, too. And I'm not even a real influencer. But this is why I justify moving to a different thing, you know, because I actually can't block or ban people from my YouTube channel, but I can on Odysee.
