# Red Team Research Blog

This site presents independent research on adversary tradecraft, detection evasion, and defensive blind spots, developed through controlled lab experimentation and long-form technical analysis.

The focus is on **how modern attack chains are constructed**, **why certain detections fail**, and **what defenders can realistically observe and mitigate**—bridging the gap between red teaming, reverse engineering, and detection engineering.

Content may include:
- High-level analysis of multi-stage attack chains  
- Defensive implications of publicly disclosed vulnerabilities  
- Research diagrams and annotated threat models  
- Video demonstrations hosted on external platforms  
- Commentary on detection limits and analyst workload  

All material is produced for **educational and defensive research purposes** and avoids operational deployment guidance.
